        As per National Crime Records Bureau which is available up to 2016, the details of State/UT-wise cases registered under crime against women and crime against children during 2014- 2016 are at Annexure-I.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ministry recognizes that incidence of crime against women cannot be controlled unless mindsets of people, in general, are made to change. There are many reasons behind increasing crimes against women such as unequal economic, social and political status of women, patriarchal mindsets etc.

        ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities towards maintenance of law and order and protection of life and property of citizens rest primarily with State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, safety and security of women and children in the country is of utmost priority for the Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been administering various special laws relating to women such as ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, ‘The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, and ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006’. India is signatory to United Nations Convention on Right of Child (UNCRC) since 1992. In adherence to its commitment to ensure child rights, the Government has framed the National Policy for Children 2013 and National Plan of Action 2016. It has also framed Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and The Commissions for Protection of Child Right (CPCR) Act, 2005.
